Would be the leitmotiv 


Abstract: 

A purely peer-to-peer system based on book, allowing through physical and eletronical versions, a knowledge's based economy. 
A book is defined as a text printed with limited copies. 

Why books can not be our next "Currency"? 

Based on Satoshi's work, a blockchain and the bitcoin that come along allow to decentralized financial system. Through the blockchain, the user is it's own bank, can be the one that create wealth and can preserve data integrity and privacy. first thing first, thanks you. 

This work through mathematical proof, named Proof of Work. This Proof, through computation, allow  to verify data integrity and avoid digital issue like double spending, thanks to these people that keep the system alive, they are paid with a currency named Satoshi.   

Now, can we imagine a knowledge's based system. this system has been thought by many, but noting has been achieved yet. 

A knowledge based system could not really work without a "currency, the first goal of a currency is to allow trading and set a value to a unit. 

Can we imagine a book, being the currency of this knowledge system. we think everything is here to say it's possible. A book is by itself a unit, it can have scarcity just like gold, and can be divised through page, paragraphe, line etc. 
To compare with bitcoin: 
the bitcoin as a unit, the bitcoin, and can be divised with satoshi etc, just like book. 
(this page is not talking about shit coin like Dollar or Euro, because these money have no scarcity (eg: value) (refer to bretton woods)

the main issue with Bitcoin was the double spending, saying that any digital things can be duplicate, and this is why the bitcoin technology is the most important inspiration.
Thanks to this work, we can pay books author or even "pay" (give knowledge, is a prefered term) with book, and even more make our society seeking knwoledge instead of seeking money. For this we need the blockchain technology. 

A book is by nature decentralized (actually we can make our heads around the potential fact, book is the fist blockchain), every one that can read and write, can write or read a book. 

A big things that retain people to get into Bitcoin is that they don't see the use. Because it's eletronical, and can't be used elsewhere than internet. But with book, you can have the printed copie with you,  even if you spend your book from your ledger, you will loose "money" but you can still keep the book, actually you can not loose knowledge. 

this projet is totally open, without any lead but the democratic lead. Feel free to join ❤
